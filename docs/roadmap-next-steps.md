**Result:**
A clean, powerful 22-app suite without redundancy.

## 3. Design & UI Principles (Light + Dark Mode)

These rules guide visual consistency across the dashboard.

### Live App Cards

- Full-opacity text and content
- Elevated shadow: shadow-lg (dark) / shadow-md (light)
- Teal primary CTAs
- Hover: slight lift + enhanced shadow

### Coming Q1 2026 Cards

- Title fully visible
- All explanatory text behind a soft frosted/gray overlay
- Centered pill: "Coming Q1 2026"
- No hover lift (to distinguish from live tools)
- Subtle border + mild shadow so they still feel premium

### Category Sections

- Icon + title + short contextual line
- Consistent spacing
- Max-width limits for better readability on large screens

### Sidebar UX

- Active tool: teal left border
- Inactive tools: softened text color
- Hover states: light ghost backgrounds
- Mirrors same category groupings as dashboard

## 4. Technical Roadmap – Next Steps

### Phase 1 – Complete In-Development Tools
