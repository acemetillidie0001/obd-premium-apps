# OBD Ecosystem Overview

## What this page IS

- A **read-only** map and explanation of how OBD tools are designed to work together.
- A reinforcement of the suite’s “explicit control” posture:
  - apply-only
  - draft-first
  - manual linking (when linking exists)
- A quick orientation page linked from key apps and suite navigation.

## What this page is NOT

- Not an automation hub.
- Not a workflow engine.
- Not a place to “sync everything.”
- Not a place that creates, links, or changes data automatically.

## Where it lives

- Route: `/apps/ecosystem`
- Name: “OBD Ecosystem Overview”

## What you typically get (outputs)

- A static relationship map (conceptual) between apps.
- Brief explanatory sections describing what each relationship means.
- Print-friendly formatting for sharing/review.

## Draft & export behavior

- No actions: the page is informational only.
- It exists to clarify that cross-app behavior is explicit (review-first) and never hidden automation.

## Integrations & boundaries

- Linked from the Help Center and Premium Dashboard, and from helper areas inside:
  - Brand Kit
  - AI Help Desk
  - Scheduler & Booking
  - CRM
- Hover tooltips on the connector lines are **desktop-only** (no mobile dependency).

## Common questions

- **Does it “connect my tools” automatically?** No—this is a read-only explanation page.
- **Is it safe to explore?** Yes—there are no actions and no background changes.
