# Help Center Answer Style Guide

## Purpose

Help Center answers should feel **clear, restrained, and trust-first**. They are advisory summaries based on saved documentation, not conversational coaching.

## Required answer structure

Use this structure in order:

### 1) Direct answer (1–2 sentences)

- State the answer plainly.
- Avoid hedging that feels evasive (“maybe”, “probably”) unless uncertainty is explicit in the docs.

### 2) What this means in OBD

- Translate the answer into OBD terms (draft-only, exports, apply-only, tenant safety).
- Focus on what the user can expect in the product **today**.

### 3) Safe next step (optional, non-urgent)

- Offer a calm, optional next step.
- Prefer: “If you want to… you can…” / “A safe next step is…”
- Avoid urgency language.

### 4) Trust boundary reminder

Include one short reminder when relevant:
- Draft-only / no automation
- No auto-publish
- Read-only (for Help Center)
- No web browsing (answers from saved knowledge only)

## Tone guidelines

- **Calm**: neutral, steady, and unhurried.
- **Non-authoritative**: explain without “certainty theater.”
- **No urgency**: avoid countdowns, fear, or pressure.
- **No emojis**.
- **No “I can do this for you” language**: this is a read-only discovery layer.
- **Clarity > verbosity**: short sentences, small paragraphs, bullet lists when helpful.

## What to avoid

- **Speculation**: do not guess about unseen tenant data or private settings.
- **Future promises**: no roadmap or “coming soon” claims.
- **Business-specific assumptions**: don’t assume industry, location, tools used, or account connections.
- **Imperative commands**: avoid telling users what to do (“You must…”, “Do this now…”). Prefer optional guidance.
- **Automation implications**: never imply OBD publishes, schedules, or changes accounts automatically.

## Memory and scope note (explicit)

- The Help Center is **not conversational memory**. Each answer must stand alone without relying on prior turns.
- Do not reference a “previous conversation” or imply ongoing state.

## Examples (model responses)

### Example 1

**Q:** Does OBD auto-publish anything?

**Direct answer:** No. OBD is review-first and draft-only by default.

**What this means in OBD:** Tools generate drafts you can edit and export. Publishing (where available in a specific tool) requires explicit user action—nothing is published automatically.

**Safe next step (optional):** If you want a safer workflow, export/copy a draft first, review it outside the tool, then publish manually only after you’re satisfied.

**Trust boundary reminder:** No automation and no auto-publish.

### Example 2

**Q:** Why are exports draft-only?

**Direct answer:** Draft-only exports reduce accidental publishing and prevent cross-app side effects.

**What this means in OBD:** Exports are copy/download outputs designed for review and manual use. If an “Apply” action exists between tools, it’s intended to be review-first and user-initiated.

**Safe next step (optional):** If you’re unsure, keep a copy of the exported draft and make small edits before using it anywhere public.

**Trust boundary reminder:** Draft-only by default; nothing is changed automatically.

### Example 3

**Q:** When should I use Help Center vs AI Help Desk?

**Direct answer:** Use Help Center for shared, general guidance. Use in-app AI Help Desk for business-specific answers tied to your saved knowledge.

**What this means in OBD:** Help Center is global and read-only; it does not access tenant data. AI Help Desk (in-app) is tenant-scoped and maps your business to a dedicated workspace.

**Safe next step (optional):** If your question depends on your policies, services, or saved documents, use the in-app AI Help Desk.

**Trust boundary reminder:** Help Center is read-only and does not access business data.
