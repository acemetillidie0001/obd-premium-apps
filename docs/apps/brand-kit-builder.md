## Overview

The Brand Kit Builder is the foundation of the OBD Premium Apps suite. It helps businesses create a comprehensive brand profile that powers content generation, review responses, social posts, and AI tools across the entire platform. By saving your Brand Kit once, all OBD apps automatically match your voice, messaging, and local details.

## What It Powers

Your Brand Kit is used by the following OBD apps to maintain consistency:

- **AI Content Writer** — Matches brand voice and personality in blog posts, service pages, and website content
- **Review Responder** — Uses brand voice and personality for authentic, on-brand review responses
- **Social Media Post Creator** — Applies brand voice, tone, and messaging guidelines to social posts
- **FAQ Generator** — Incorporates brand voice and personality into FAQ content
- **AI Help Desk** — Uses brand voice and messaging for customer support responses
- **Image Caption Generator** — Applies brand voice and tone to image captions

## Brand Snapshot & Completeness

### Brand Snapshot

A live-updating mini card near the top of the form shows your current brand details at a glance:

- Language

The snapshot updates in real-time as you type, helping you see what's been filled in before generating your Brand Kit.

The Brand Kit Completeness indicator shows your progress on core fields as a percentage. Completing these core fields ensures all OBD apps have the essential information needed to generate consistent, on-brand content.

## Prompt Intelligence

### Customer Language Integration

The Brand Kit Builder now captures real customer language and reasons for choosing your business:

- **How Customers Describe You** — Incorporates authentic customer words into AI-generated content
- **Why Customers Choose You** — Strengthens messaging by highlighting your competitive advantages

When provided, these fields are automatically included in the AI prompt, helping generate content that resonates with your actual customers and reflects real reasons they choose you.

### Brand Voice & Tone

The app supports multiple layers of voice control:

1. **Brand Personality** (core field) — Select from predefined personalities
2. **Brand Voice** (advanced) — Custom description that overrides personality if provided

### "What Was Created" Summary

A checklist panel shows exactly what was generated based on your settings, helping you quickly see what's available to use.

## Integration Philosophy

### No Forced Handoff

The Brand Kit Builder follows a **link-only, no-payload** integration model:

- **Next Steps Links** — Simple navigation links to dependent apps
- **No Query Parameters** — Links are clean, no data handoff
- **No Auto-Population** — Users manually navigate and choose when to use their Brand Kit

This approach respects user agency and prevents unexpected data mutations.

### Suite-Aware Design

The app clearly communicates its role as the foundation:

- **"This powers your OBD tools"** — Info block explaining suite-wide usage
- **"Used by" chips** — Visual indicators showing which apps use the Brand Kit
- **Next Steps panel** — Direct links to apps that benefit from your Brand Kit

## Status: Reference-Quality / Maintenance Mode

The Brand Kit Builder has reached **Tier 5** (Reference-Quality) status:

- ✅ Complete UX polish and clarity improvements
- ✅ Comprehensive brand intelligence fields
- ✅ Suite integration signals and navigation
- ✅ Dark mode support and accessibility
- ✅ Production-ready and stable

The app is now in **maintenance mode** — fully functional, well-documented, and ready for ongoing use. Future enhancements will focus on maintenance and minor refinements rather than major feature additions.
