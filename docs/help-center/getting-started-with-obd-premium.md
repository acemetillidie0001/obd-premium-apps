# Getting Started with OBD Premium (Suite Mental Model)

## What OBD Premium is

OBD Premium is a **suite of tools** (not a single tool). Each tool helps you produce a specific kind of business draft:
- pages and on-site copy
- profiles and descriptions
- FAQs and schemas
- review and reputation workflows
- scheduling and operational drafts

## The default workflow (draft → edit → export)

Most OBD tools follow the same pattern:
- **Draft**: generate a starting point (often called “Generated”).
- **Edit**: adjust content to match your business (often called “Edited”).
- **Export**: copy/download content, or hand it off **as a draft** to another tool.

This is intentional: you stay in control, and changes happen only when you choose them.

## How apps relate to each other

Think in “draft packs”:
- One app generates a draft pack for a purpose (e.g., a local landing page, a post set, a GBP rewrite pack).
- Another app can reuse that draft pack through **explicit, apply-only handoffs**.

Handoffs are designed to be safe:
- user-initiated
- review-first
- additive/fill-empty patterns when “Apply” exists

## OBD Ecosystem Overview (read-only)

- Route: `/apps/ecosystem`
- Purpose: a read-only explanation of how OBD Premium apps are designed to work together.
- Emphasis: explicit control, draft-first workflows, and no background automation.
- Includes: a static relationship map (conceptual), plus small legend/tooltips and print-friendly styles.
- Linked from: Help Center, Premium Dashboard, Brand Kit Builder, AI Help Desk, Scheduler & Booking, and CRM.

## Where new users should start

If you are new to the suite:
- Start with the tool closest to your goal (local pages, GBP, reviews, content).
- Generate one draft pack.
- Export/copy it or reuse it in the next tool.

If you’re unsure where to begin:
- Use the Help Center for shared guidance and definitions (global, read-only).
- Use the in-app AI Help Desk for business-specific guidance (tenant-scoped).

## Get started with OBD (dashboard setup guide)

OBD includes a **non-blocking, advisory-only** setup guide panel called **“Get started with OBD”**.

What it does:
- Shows **recommended setup steps** (no enforced order).
- Shows a **progress bar** (required steps only; optional steps do not affect percent).
- Uses **deterministic status derivation** from existing stored data only (no automation, no external calls).

Where to find it:
- **Dashboard panel**: on the Premium Dashboard (`/apps`) near the top of the page.
- **Sidebar link**: “Get Started” → `/apps#get-started`
- **Help Center link**: “Get Started with OBD” → `/apps#get-started`

Dismiss behavior:
- The panel includes a **Dismiss** button (explicit action).
- Dismissal is **business-scoped** and persisted; it hides the panel without affecting any tools.
- You can re-enable it with **“Show setup guide”** (explicit action).

## What “advisory-only” means

“Advisory-only” means:
- The tool provides guidance, drafts, and suggested next steps.
- It does **not** publish, send, schedule, or change accounts automatically.
- You can review and decide what to do with the output.

## Calm reassurance (you cannot “break” anything)

OBD tools are designed to fail safely:
- Most actions are draft-only and reversible (edit/cancel/reset).
- Exports are copy/download workflows, not publishing workflows.
- Cross-app integrations are link-only or apply-only (no silent writes).
